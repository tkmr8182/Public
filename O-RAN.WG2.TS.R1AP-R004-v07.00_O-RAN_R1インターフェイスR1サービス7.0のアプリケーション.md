# 4 Application protocol for the R1 services

## 4.1 Introduction

The present document contains a realization for the procedures identified in O-RAN TS R1GAP [5]. It is based on transport protocols as defined in R1TP [7]. This definition of the R1 Application Protocols (R1AP) defined in the present document is based on the 3GPP service framework for network functions specified in 3GPP TS 29.501 [1] .

## 4.2 Version conventions for the present document

The version number of the present document follows the “xx.yy“ versioning scheme. There could be implications for the interoperability between rApps and R1 service API implementations in SMO/Non-RT RIC framework that are based on different versions of the present document.

An incremented “xx“ version field of the present document could indicate that a new major feature (e.g., a new R1 service) has been added or that an incompatible change has been made to one or more R1 service APIs. An incremented “yy“ version field could indicate that an optional feature has been added, a technical issue has been fixed, or that clarifications or editorial corrections have been made.

The version conventions for RESTful R1 service APIs are defined in clause 5.2.

# 5 RESTful R1 service APIs

## 5.1 Overview

The design of the RESTful R1 service APIs is based on the procedures and requirements defined in R1UCR [6] and R1GAP [5], and on the protocol design framework as specified in 3GPP TS 29.501 [1] .

The API version of a service API includes a pre-release version (e.g., “-alpha.1“) if the service API is under development.

The present document defines the protocols for the R1 service APIs listed in table 5.1-1.

Table 5.1-1: RESTful R1 service APIs and their versions defined in the present document.

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| R1 Services | Service API | API Version |
| Service management and exposure services | Service registration | 1.2.0 |
| Service discovery | 1.2.0 |

| AI/ML model discovery | 1.0.0-alpha.1 |
| AI/ML model training | 1.0.0-alpha.1 |

## 5.2 Versioning of RESTful R1 service APIs

Each RESTful R1 service API is versioned independently. The API version number defined in the present document contains three numerical fields following a MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH pattern, and may contain a pre-release version field, according to SemVer [11].

The API version number held by an implementation may additionally include a build metadata field, according to SemVer [11], to indicate a specific deployment. The content of this field is implementation specific; it is provided by the deployment. The <apiVersion> path segment used in URI structures indicate the MAJOR field of the API version number. The full API version number is visible in the “version“ field of the “info“ object of each OpenAPI document in Annex A, as well as in the ServiceAPIDescription information communicated during service registration and service discovery (see annex B.3.4.1).

To indicate the full API version the API Consumer intends to use, the API Consumer may include the “Version“ HTTP header (see IETF RFC 4229[13] ) in an HTTP request, in which case the header shall contain the version identifier as defined above. It is optional to include the build metadata field.

The API Producer shall include in the response the “Version“ HTTP header signalling the used API version, including the build metadata if available. If the build metadata have been omitted in the request, the API Producer shall use the combination of MAJOR, MINOR, PATCH, and pre-release indicator as requested and the highest supported value for the build metadata field for that combination, if available. In case the API Consumer has not sent a “Version“ header in the request, the API Producer shall use the latest available version, and signal it in the “Version“ header.

NOTE: In case multiple versions are supported by an API Producer under the URI for a major version, this allows the API Consumer to request a particular version. This mechanism is referred to as “microversioning“.

If the API version signalled by the API Consumer in the “Version“ request header is not supported by the API Producer, the API Producer shall respond with a “406 Not Acceptable“ error and may include in the response payload body a Problem Details structure providing more information on the cause of the error.

## 5.3 URI structure and supported content formats

This clause specifies the URI prefix and the supported content formats applicable to the RESTful R1 service APIs.

All resource URIs of the APIs shall have the following prefix:

**{apiRoot}/<apiName>/<apiVersion>/**

The request URIs used in HTTP requests from the API Consumer towards the API Producer shall have the resource URI structure defined in clause 4.4.1 of 3GPP TS 29.501 [1] , i.e.:

**{apiRoot}/<apiName>/<apiVersion>/<apiSpecificResourceUriPart>**

with the following components:

- The {apiRoot} shall be set as described in clause 4.4.1 of 3GPP TS 29.501 [1] ; however, the restrictions w.r.t the operator specific FQDN of the host portion defined there do not apply.

- The <apiName> indicates the API name of the service interface in an abbreviated form. It is defined in the clause specifying the corresponding RESTful R1 service API.

- The <apiVersion> indicates the major version (see clause 5.2) of the API and is defined in the clause specifying the corresponding RESTful R1 serviceAPI.

- Each <apiSpecificResourceUriPart> represents a specific resource of the API. It is defined in the corresponding RESTful R1 service API for each one of the defined resources.

For HTTP requests and responses that have message content, the content format JSON (see IETF RFC 8259 [12]) shall be supported. The JSON format shall be signalled by the content type “application/json“.

All resource URIs of the API shall comply with the URI syntax as defined in IETF RFC 3986 [8]. An implementation that dynamically generates resource URI parts (individual path segments, sequences of path segments that are separated by “/“, query parameter values) shall ensure that these parts only use the character set that is allowed by IETF RFC 3986 [8] for these parts.

## 5.4 General considerations for RESTful R1 service APIs

### 5.4.1 Usage of HTTP header fields

HTTP headers are components of the headers section of the HTTP request and response messages. The usage of HTTP header fields shall follow the definitions in clause 4.2 of ETSI GS NFV-SOL 013 [4].

### 5.4.2 Handling of large query results

The handling of large query results shall be supported by RESTful R1 service APIs as specified in clause 5.4.2 of ETSI GS NFV-SOL 013 [4].

### 5.4.3 Error reporting

In RESTful interfaces, application errors are mapped to HTTP errors. Since HTTP error information is generally not enough to discover the root cause of the error, additional application specific error information is typically delivered in the message content based on the ProblemDetails data type.

HTTP error responses shall be supported as specified in clause 4.8 of 3GPP TS 29.501 [1] . Protocol errors and application errors specified in table 5.2.7.1-1 of 3GPP TS 29.500 [2] shall be supported for an HTTP method if the corresponding HTTP status codes are specified as mandatory for that HTTP method in table 5.2.7.1-1 of 3GPP TS 29.500 [2].

If an HTTP method is not defined for a particular resource in the present document, that method is not supported. When that method is requested on the resource, the API Producer shall return a “405 Method Not Allowed“ response. The message content may include a ProblemDetails structure.

# 6 Service management and exposure services

## 6.1 Service registration API

### 6.1.1 Introduction

This API allows the API Consumer to manage registrations of service APIs based on the procedures for “Registration of services“ defined in O-RAN TS R1GAP [5].

### 6.1.2 API version

For the service registration APIas specified in the present document, the MAJOR version field shall be 1, the MINOR version field shall be 2 and the PATCH version field shall be 0 (see clause 4.3.1.1 of 3GPP TS 29.501 [1] for a definition of the version fields). Consequently, the <apiVersion> URI path segment shall be set to “v1“.

### 6.1.3 Resource structure and methods

The request URIs used in HTTP requests from the API Consumer towards the API Producer shall have the resource URI structure as defined for the CAPIF\_Publish\_Service\_API (see Figure 8.2.2.1-1 in Clause 8.2.2 in 3GPP TS 29.222[9]).

Table 6.1.3-1 lists the individual resources defined for the API, the applicable HTTP methods as defined in clause 8.2 of 3GPP TS 29.222 [9]) and the associated service operations.

Table 6.1.3-1: Resources and methods overview of the service registration API

|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Resource Name**  3GPP TS 29.222 [9] | **Resource URI**  3GPP TS 29.222 [9] | **HTTP method**  3GPP TS 29.222 [9] | **Service Operation** |
| APF published APIs | /{apfId}/service-apis | POST | Register service API |
| GET | Query service APIs |
| Individual APF published API | /{apfId}/service-apis/{serviceApiId} | PUT | Update registered service API |
| DELETE | Deregister service API |
| PATCH | Partial update registered service API |

### 6.1.4 Service operations

#### 6.1.4.1 Register service API

### 9.1.9 Error Handling

#### 9.1.9.1 General

In addition to the general provisions in clause 5.4.3, the requirements in the following clauses are applicable for the A1 policy management API.

#### 9.1.9.2 Protocol Errors

No specific protocol errors are defined in the present document.

#### 9.1.9.3 Application Errors

The application errors defined for the A1 policy management service are listed in table 9.1.9.3-1.

Table 9.1.9.3-1: Application errors

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Application Error | HTTP status code | Description |
| Unauthorized | 401 | Used when the API consumer lacks proper authentication credentials or has provided invalid credentials |
| Forbidden | 403 | Used when the API Consumer has successfully authenticated the user, but the user is still denied access to the requested resource. |
| Bad Request | 400 | Used when the A1 policy management service cannot or will not process a request, e.g., when the validation of PolicyObject towards a policy type schema, or the validation of PolicyStatusObject towards a policy status schema, fails. |
| Not Found | 404 | Used when the Near-RT RIC did not find a current representation for the resource representing a policy type or a policy, e.g., for a policy type that is not available or a policy that does not exist. |
| Method Not Allowed | 405 | Used when the HTTP method is not supported by the resource defined for the A1 policy management API. |
| Conflict | 409 | Used if detecting that a policy requested to be created or updated may be overlapping or conflicting with a policy that exists in the Near-RT RIC. |

Application errors should be mapped to the most applicable 4xx/5xx HTTP error status code. If no such status code is applicable, one of the status codes 400 (Bad Request) or 500 (Internal Server Error) should be used.

The HTTP status codes listed in table 9.1.9.3-1 shall be used as defined in clause 5.4.3 for the A1 policy management procedures and clause 9.1.5 for the resources.

Implementations may use additional HTTP error status codes in addition to those listed in table 9.1.9.3-1, as long as they are valid HTTP status codes.

A list of all valid HTTP status codes and their specification documents can be obtained from the HTTP status code registry [21].

In addition, the response body may contain a JSON representation of a “ProblemDetails“ data structure in the payload body as defined in clause 9.1.8.2.2. In that case, as defined by IETF RFC 7807 [10], the “Content-Type“ HTTP header shall be set to “application/problem+json“.

# 10. AI/ML workflow services

## 10.1 AI/ML model registration API

### 10.1.1 Introduction

This API enables the API Consumer to register, query, update and deregister an AI/ML model based on the AI/Ml model registration service defined in O-RAN TS R1GAP [5].

### 10.1.2 API version

Consequently, the <apiVersion> URI path segment shall be set to “v1“.

The AI/ML model registration API is under development and consequently the API version shall include the pre-release version “alpha.1“.

### 10.1.3 Resource structure and methods

The request URIs used in HTTP requests from the API Consumer towards the API Producer shall have the resource URI structure as defined in clause 5.2. The <apiName> resource URI variable shall be “ai-ml-model-registration“. The <apiSpecificResourceUriPart> for each resource shall be set as described in clause 10.1.5.

Figure 10.1.3-1 shows the overall resource URI structure defined for the model registration API.

### A.3.4 HTTP based Push data API

Deliberately, no OpenAPI is specified for this API in the present document.

NOTE: OpenAPI requires the definition of the valid content types for the request message content. However, this API is agnostic with respect to the content type of the data carried in the request message. Within the DME services, the valid content types are defined as part of separate data message schemas which specify the structure of the data to be carried over the API. Because of the requirement to fix the content types that can be carried over the API, defining an OpenAPI would restrict the versatility of the API.

### A.3.5 HTTP based Pull data API
