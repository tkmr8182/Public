## [0.2.7] - 2025-07-07

### üöÄ New Features
- **SETUP Phase**: Added new initial phase to establish workflow environment and file organization patterns before starting analysis
- **Simplified AUDIT_INVENTORY**: Reduced required documentation from 5 files to 2 files (01-audit-analysis.md and 01-inventory-changes.json)

### üõ†Ô∏è Improvements
- **Fixed ITERATE and PRESENT Phases**: Added missing `requiredOutputFiles` arrays to ensure consistent file output patterns
- **Clarified File Path Patterns**: Replaced ambiguous `${outputDir}` references with explicit `structured-workflow/{task-name}/` patterns throughout all phases
- **Updated Documentation Examples**: Fixed misleading file name examples (e.g., "analysis.md") to use correct numbered patterns (e.g., "01-audit-analysis.md")
- **Improved phase_output Guidance**: Clarified confusing "files OR structured JSON" phrasing to emphasize numbered file naming convention

### üêõ Bug Fixes
- Fixed file creation inconsistencies where early phases created unnumbered files in project root while later phases correctly used numbered files in workflow-output directory
- Updated phase numbering to accommodate new SETUP phase (SETUP=0, AUDIT=1, etc.)

### üîß Internal
- Updated Phase type definition to include SETUP
- Updated validation criteria for all phases
- Updated workflow presets to include SETUP phase
- Enhanced file system utilities to support new phase numbering

## [0.2.6] - 2025-07-05

- ### üõ†Ô∏è Improvements
- **Phase Guidance Enhancements**: Inject universal tool-usage reminders into all suggestive and directive phases (audit, compare, write/refactor, lint, iterate, present).
- **Test Coverage**: Added normalization in Jest tests to handle Unicode hyphen variants in guidance instructions.

## [0.2.4] - 2025-07-04

### ‚ôªÔ∏è Improvements
- **Automatic Output Directory Resolution**: Relative paths for `outputDirectory` are now resolved against the current project root via new `resolveOutputDirectory()` helper.
- **Pre-flight Directory Validation**: Workflow creation now validates & creates the resolved directory, avoiding ENOENT errors.
- **Robust Integration Tests**: Tests accept both relative and absolute default paths, ensuring CI stability across environments.
- **Code Clean-up**: Removed duplicate properties and tightened type checks in `buildCustomWorkflow`.

### üêõ Bug Fixes
- Fixed workflow creation failure when default directory could not be created from outside repo working directory.

### üîß Internal
- Version bumped to 0.2.4.
