### 2. Copy and Customize
Each template provides:
- **Quick Copy-Paste Template**: Minimal version for fast use
- **Best Practices Template**: Detailed version with all options
- **Complete Example**: Real-world usage demonstration
- **Customization Guide**: How to fill in placeholders effectively

### 3. Follow the Structure
All templates include these key components:
- **Context Setting**: Project background and constraints
- **Clear Objectives**: Specific, measurable goals
- **Success Criteria**: How you'll know when you're done
- **Technical Requirements**: Implementation constraints and preferences

## Template Features

### üìã Placeholder-Based Design
Templates use `[PLACEHOLDER]` format for easy customization:
```
Project: [PROJECT_NAME]
Language: [PROGRAMMING_LANGUAGE]  
Objective: [DETAILED_DESCRIPTION]
```

### üéØ Best Practices Integration
Based on 2024 AI prompt engineering research:
- **Specificity**: Clear, detailed requirements over vague descriptions
- **Context**: Comprehensive background information
- **Structure**: Organized sections for better AI understanding
- **Emotional stimuli**: Phrases that improve AI performance
- **Step-by-step guidance**: Systematic approach requests

### üîß MCP Server Integration
All templates properly integrate with the Structured Workflow MCP Server:
- Correct tool names and calling patterns
- Platform prefix guidance for compatibility
- Output artifact requirements
- Phase progression expectations

### üåê Platform Compatibility
Templates include guidance for different AI platforms:
- Tool name prefix variations (`mcp_`, `mcp7_`, etc.)
- Discovery tools for checking available commands
- Error troubleshooting guidance

## Advanced Usage Tips

### üé® Customization Best Practices
1. **Be Specific**: Replace placeholders with precise, detailed information
2. **Provide Context**: Include relevant background about your codebase and constraints
3. **Set Clear Goals**: Define measurable success criteria
4. **Consider Your Team**: Tailor language and complexity to your team's expertise

### üöÄ Performance Optimization
- Use emotional context: "This is critical for our Q4 goals"
- Request systematic approach: "Take a deep breath and work through this step-by-step"
- Specify quality focus: "This needs to be production-ready"
- Include constraints upfront: "Cannot modify the database schema"

### üîç Troubleshooting
If you encounter issues:
1. Check tool name prefixes for your platform
2. Use `mcp__structured-workflow__discover_workflow_tools` to see available commands
3. Verify MCP server is properly connected
4. Review the output artifact requirements
